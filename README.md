# CS3354-Group18-Smart-Meals

## Purpose
Many meal planner apps available today require users to manually add meals for each day or week. These apps often lack features that allow users to input the ingredients they already have to generate an optimized meal plan or suggest additional ingredients needed to make specific dishes they want. For our project, we propose the development of a smart meal planner web-based application that provides the user with a list of meals they can make for the day or week given the ingredients they currently have, as well as suggesting certain ingredients to purchase and providing detailed nutrition facts for each meal. 

## Target Customers
- Health-conscious individuals - people who want to maintain a healthy diet or follow specific nutritional goals for weight loss, muscle gain, and managing health conditions such as diabetes or heart disease.
- Students and busy professionals - due to their busy schedules, professionals and students may want to easily stick to a healthy meal routine using the ingredients they have to eliminate time spent on meal planning. 

## Value Proposition
This application helps consumers brainstorm ideas on what meals they can cook with the items in their pantry. Many amateurs do not know the amount of meals they have at their disposal. This will give them inspiration they need to cook more at home and saves time spent on meal planning.
